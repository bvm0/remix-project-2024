          <h2>Three Main Perspectives</h2>
          <h3 id="utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</h3>
          <p>Utilitarianism is a normative philosophy according to which the rightness of an action is determined by the utility that it would provide. In this context, utility is defined as the overall "well-being or hapiness of sentient beings"; the utility provided by an action can be thought of as the total net change hapiness of all those affected by the action in question. Utilitarians believe that the action which provides the greatest utility is the right action.<sup><a href="sources.html#src16">16, 17</a></sup></p>
          <p>Applying utilitarianism to the question of whether the minimum wage should be raised requires an assessment of the effects of such an increase. If the benefits outweight the drawbacks, utilitarianism suggests that the minimum wage should be raised. When it comes to the minimum wage, the potential for inflation and higher unemployment are the primary risks of an increase.<sup><a href="sources.html#src18">18</a></sup> In reality, though, these risks are unlikely to come to fruition. For one, high inflation is a <em>reason to increase</em> the minimum wage; if minimum wage earners continue receive just $7.25 per hour of work as the purchasing power of the US dollar decreases, their ability to independently sustain themselves will continue to diminish.<sup><a href="sources.html#src19">19</a></sup> The research done by David Card and Alan Krueger as well as other economists indicates little to no increase in unemployment when the minimum wage is increased.<sup href="sources.html#src20"><a>20</a></sup> In contrast, the benefits of raising the minimum wage are clear. Increasing the federal minimum wage would affect near-minimum wage earners too, raising it to $15 per hour could lift as many as 7.6 million people out of poverty.<sup><a href="sources.html#src21">21</a></sup> The significant positive effects and miniscule negative ones make raising the minimum wage the right move from a utilitarian perspective.</p>
          <h3 id="kantianism">Kantian Ethics</h3>
          <p>Kantian ethics is a moral philosophy developed by Immanuel Kant just over two centuries ago. A form of deontology, Kantianism relies on rules that dictate actions.<sup><a href="sources.html#src22">22</a></sup> Specifically, adherents to Kantian ethics appeal to what he called the Categorical Imperative, first penned in <em>Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals</em>: "Act only on that maxim whereby thou canst at the same time will that it should become universal law." In other words, the Categorical Imperative says that one should act only in such a way that they would will <em>anyone</em> to act in that situation.<sup><a href="sources.html#src23">23</a></sup></p>
          <p>The application of Kantian ethics to the question at hand necessitates an evaluation of its congruence with the Categorical Imperative. This is more easily done using one of Kant's alternative formulations of the rule, called the Formula of Humanity: "So act as to treat humanity, whether in thine own person or in that of any other, in every case as an end withal, never as a means only." <sup><a href="sources.html#src23">23, 24</a></sup> The most obvious conclusion regarding wages that can be drawn from this formulation is that workers must be compensated the full value of their work, as any less would mean treating the worker as a means but not an end in themselves. This conclusion does not necessarily mean the minimum wage should be raised (it certainly seems <em>possible</em> for someone to do work worth less than $7.25 per hour), but a compelling argument does still follow from the Formula of Humanity. Specifically, that the Kantian approach compels employers to pay their employees more than a living wage, as any less would allow no room for growth (as all income would be spent merely to survive), and it could not be willed for <em>all</em> employers to subject their employees to such circumstances.<sup><a href="sources.html#src25">25</a></sup></p>
          <h3 id="catholic">Catholic Ethics</h3>
          <p>Christian ethics are widespread throughout the United States and the two main  divisions within this category are Catholic and Protestant ethics. While Protestantism's emphasis of the principles of <em>sola fide</em> and <em>sola scriptura</em> make an analysis especially difficult, Catholic ethics are quite more straightforward. While Catholics believe their ethical principles ultimately come from God, they rely on the teachings of the Church to communicate them.<sup href="sources.html#src26"><a>26</a></sup> Thus, official Church positions such as those communicated in encyclicals can be used to assess the rightness of actions.</p>
          <p>The Church's view on the minimum wage is abundantly clear: it should be raised. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, an "assembly of the Catholic Church hierarchy of the United States,"<sup><a href="sources.html#src27">27</a></sup> wrote in a report that "Catholic Bishops in the United States have long supported increases in the federal minimum wage to ensure that no full time worker and their family lived in poverty."<sup><a href="sources.html#src28">28</a></sup> One argument for this view is based on Pope Leo XIII's encyclical <em>Rerum Novarum</em>. Here, Leo XIII contends that the worker has the right to earn a living wage, as well as that the government has a role in ensuring the rights of the poor, as they do not otherwise have the ability to do so in the same way that the rich do.<sup><a href="sources.html#src29">29</a></sup> The natural conclusion is that, according to Catholic social teaching, the government should raise the minimum wage to the living wage.</p>
          <h2 id="others">Other Perspectives</h2>
          <h3 id="consequentialism">Actual Consequentialism</h3>
          <p>Actual consequentialism contends that the morality of an action depends on the actual consequences of that action, as opposed to the "forseen, forseeable, intended, or likely consequences."<sup><a href="sources.html#src30">30</a></sup> Because we cannot be <em>certain</em> of the consequences of raising the federal minimum wage, we cannot determine its morality with total certainty. However, since historical evidence and research seems to indicate that reasonable increases to the minimum wage benefit society, raising the federal minimum wage is <em>most likely</em> to be the moral action from the perspective of actual consequentialism. </p>
          <h3 id="deontology">Protestant Ethics</h3>
          <p>Protestants base their values in the teachings of the Bible and a direct relationship with God, defined by the principles of <em>sola scriptura</em> and <em>sola fide</em>, two of the "five solas".<sup><a href="sources.html#src31">31</a></sup> Because of this, many views are highly subjective and depend on interpretation. The minimum wage is an especially subjective topic in this context as it is not directly discussed in the Bible. So, while various argument for raising the minimum wage can be made from Protestant ethics, so can arguments against raising it. Unlike many other normative philosophies, then, there is not necessarily one "natural" conclusion to be reached from this perspective.</p>
          <h3>W. D. Ross's Deontological Pluralism</h3>
          <p>The deontological pluralism developed by W. D. Ross contains <em>prima facie</em> duties, which Ross believes are the guidelines by which morality is judged. One of these duties is the duty of justice, which requires that "one act in such a way that one distributes benefits and burdens fairly."<sup><a href="sources.html#src32">32</a></sup> Applying this principle to the economics suggests that the actions that reduce income desparities and ensure no individual is less financially capable of survival are moral. As increasing the minimum wage would work toward these goals, the application of W. D. Ross's deontological pluralism leads to the conclusion that the minimum wage should be raised.</p>
          <h3 id="virtue">Eudaimonistic Virtue Ethics</h3>
          <p>Eudaimonistic virtue ethics focuses on cultivating moral character and striving <em>eudaimonia</em> &mdash; a state of human flourishing or wellbeing &mdash; through the practice of virtuous habits.<sup><a href="sources.html#src33">33</a></sup> From this perspective, the whether the minimum wage should be raised depends on how it would contribute to the flourishing of individuals. As argued from the Kantian perspective, raising the minimum wage above the living wage would provide even the country's lowest earners the ability to grow and lift themselves out of poverty. By enabling minimum wage earners to improve their circumstances, raising the minimum wage aligns with the principles of eudaimonism.</p>
