          <h1>The Minimum Wage</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="main-textbox">
          <p>In 1831 and 1834, workers in Lyon, France's silk industry went on strike and demanded a minimum wage sufficient for them to live on. While their efforts ultimately failed, these workers are among the first known to strive for a minimum wage.<sup><a href="sources.html#src4">4</a></sup> Over half a century later though, one country would implement the kind of legislation they had hoped for. The world's first minimum wage was established in New Zealand in 1894&semi; this legislation and many laws that followed in other countries were initially implemented as temporary measures and only covered certain categories of workers<sup><a href="sources.html#src5">5</a></sup> Four years later, “Samuel Gompers, founding president of the American Federation of Labor, [published] an article entitled “A Minimum Living Wage.”<sup><a href="sources.html#src4">4</a></sup> This is one of the first known uses of the term “living wage”—referring to a wage sufficient to live on, as advocated by the workers in Lyon’s silk industry—and Gompers believed that it was necessary to set the legal threshold to this level.<sup><a href="sources.html#src4">4</a></sup></p>

          <p>In 1912, Massachusetts enacted the first law establishing a minimum wage in the United States. Eight more states followed in 1912 and 1913.<sup><a href="sources.html#src6">6</a></sup> The 1923 US Supreme Court case Adkins v. Children’s Hospital of D.C. struck down all minimum wage laws in the United States as unconstitutional&semi; the Court held that these laws violated the right to free contract that they believed was conveyed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.<sup><a href="sources.html#src7">7</a></sup> 14 years later, the case West Coast Hotel v. Parrish overturned this ruling. Here, the court determined that minimum wage laws were constitutional as the government can impose certain restrictions on contracts to protect health, safety, and more.<sup><a href="sources.html#8">8, 9</a></sup></p>

          <p>The United States’s first federal minimum wage was established by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA).<sup><a href="sources.html#src10">10</a></sup> This minimum wage applied to employees “engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for interstate commerce”<sup><a href="sources.html#2">2</a></sup>&semi; this made up only about one-fifth of the labor force.<sup><a href="sources.html#src1">1</a></sup> Starting at $0.25, the minimum wage increased to $0.30 a year later. The World War II years saw no increases, but the minimum wage was raised to $0.40 in 1945, then to $0.75 in 1950, and hit the $1.00 mark in 1956.<sup><a href="sources.html#src2">2</a></sup> In 1961, Congress amended the FLSA, expanding it to include “employees in large retail and service enterprises” and “local transit, construction, and gasoline service station employees.”<sup><a href="sources.html#src2">2</a></sup> 1966 amendments “extended coverage to State and local government employees of hospitals, nursing homes, and schools, and to laundries, drycleaners, and large hotels, motels, restaurants, and farms." Later amendments continued to expand its scope, and the federal minimum wage continued to rise roughly every two years until 1981, when it remained at $3.35 until 1990. It was raised to $3.80 that year, and to $4.25 a year later. After five more years, the minimum wage was set to $4.75, and then to $5.15 a year after that. This is where the minimum wage remained from 1997 until 2007, when it was raised by 70 cents per hour to $5.85. Two more increases in the next two years saw the minimum wage reach $7.25 — its current level — in 2009.<sup><a href="sources.html#src2">2</a></sup></p>

          <p>Since the decision in West Coast Hotel v. Parrish paved the way for minimum wage laws to reemerge, many individual states, counties, and cities have established their own. Massachusetts, the first state to establish a minimum wage law before they were outlawed, currently has a $15.00 minimum wage and a clause that ensures the state minimum wage is always at least 50 cents higher than the federal minimum wage. Washington currently has the highest minimum wage of any state, at $16.28. Still, various states such as Alabama do not have their own minimum wage laws at all, and others have laws that simply echo or broaden the scope of the $7.25 nationwide minimum.<sup><a href="sources.html#src11">11</a></sup></p>

          <p>Many movements to raise the minimum wage have sprouted up, especially in the 2010s.  The Fight for 15 — perhaps the most notable of these movements — began in New York City in 2012 and has prompted dozens of state and local governments to raise their minimum wages&semi; seven states and Washington D.C. now have minimum wages at or above $15.00.<sup><a href="sources.html#src12">12, 13</a></sup> One of the sources most frequently cited by advocates of a higher minimum wage is the research done by David Card and Alan Krueger in the 1990s and early 2000s, for which Card won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Economics.<sup><a href="sources.html#src14">14, 15</a></sup> Their research, which suggests that raising the minimum wage has relatively a relatively small impact on unemployment, is highly compelling and valuable. However, by citing this type of research, many movements default to utilitarian thinking, failing to consider other normative philosophies and how they might view the question of whether the minimum wage should be raised.
