          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>Since its creation during the Great Depression, the federal minimum wage has faced strong pushback from various interest groups. Still, this legislation persevered, and Congress consistently increased the minimum wage every few years through the end of the 20th century. From the 1990s onward, many academic papers on the topic were published, both supporting and decrying the federal minimum wage. Amid this growing academic discourse, questions surrounding the actual benefits of the minimum wage resurfaced in the political arena, and it has remained at $7.25 per hour since 2009 (<em>History of Federal Minimum Wage Rates</em>, n.d.), marking the longest period with no increases since the first minimum wage in 1938. However, almost all of these arguments, on either side of this discourse, share one trait: they take a distinctly consequentialist approach. 
          </p>
          <p>To ensure that American policymakers consider the values of a maximal number of people, to establish a well-informed, understanding citizenry, and to enable readers to reconcile their position on the minimum wage with their ethical principles, it is crucial that this issue be examined from the perspectives of various moral philosophies. Most value systems can be categorized as consequentialist, deontological, or virtue-ethical. While these are rather broad groups, upon investigation of the core principles of the ethical philosophies within each of these categories, it becomes clear that the natural position for those who subscribe to most such beliefs is that the minimum wage should be raised.</p>
          <p>This paper will mainly explore the question of whether the minimum wage should be raised from the perspectives of a few widespread ethical philosophies within the categories of consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics—namely, it will focus primarily on utilitarianism, Kantianism, and Catholic ethics. The utilitarian should be convinced by the preponderance of the evidence that raising the minimum wage would have significant positive effects and few, if any, negative ones. Congruence with the Categorical Imperative should persuade the Kantian ethicist that the minimum wage should be raised. And Catholic social teaching, built upon the writings of Pope Leo XIII and other Church leaders, should demonstrate the value of a higher minimum wage to Catholic Americans.
          </p>
          <h3>Utilitarianism</h3>
          <p>As described in Encyclopedia Britannica, utilitarianism is the normative philosophy “according to which an action (or type of action) is right if it tends to promote happiness or pleasure and wrong if it tends to produce unhappiness or pain—not just for the performer of the action, but also for everyone else affected by it” (West & Duignan, 2024). In other words, an action is morally right if it maximizes the difference between total pleasure and total pain—this difference is called utility, and it is ultimately what utilitarians intrinsically value. When it comes to the question at hand, the mathematical approach that this ethical framework uses necessitates a detailed examination of the specific consequences of raising the federal minimum wage. The claim that raising the minimum wage would have a net benefit to Americans is multifaceted, and each aspect has been argued by various economists. 
          </p>
          <p>Perhaps the biggest uncertainty regarding the impacts of proposed increases is that on unemployment. One paper that attempted to clear the air on this issue is David Card and Alan B. Krueger’s “Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania: Reply” (2000). This publication was the third entry in a dialogue between the authors and fellow economists David Neumark and William Wascher. Card and Krueger’s initial paper examined unemployment using their own methodology and data collected themselves (Card & Krueger, 1994); Neumark and Wascher responded by using the same methodology, with their own data (Neumark & Wascher, 2000). This third publication, in which Card and Krueger used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and again the same methodology, affirmed the findings of their first paper: in their own words, “The increase in New Jersey’s minimum wage probably had no effect on total employment in New Jersey’s fast-food industry, and possibly had a small positive effect” (Card & Krueger, 2000, p. 1419). Card received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work (Nobel Prize Outreach, 2021); Krueger passed away in 2019 and the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously, but Card is adamant that Krueger would have shared the award had he been alive (Noah, 2021, para. 3).
          </p>
          <p>While Card and Krueger backed up their claim with strong evidence and the reception of the Nobel Prize displays its importance, it is crucial to note that all of the data used in all three papers focused on the 1992 minimum wage increase in New Jersey, specifically within the fast-food industry. However, their paper is far from the only one arguing this point. In the BLS’s Monthly Labor Review, Jonathan Yoe wrote that, while the “basic economics 101 explanation” concludes that a minimum wage increase would lead to higher unemployment, “several studies have found that an increase in the minimum wage changes employment little, if at all” (2021). Increasing unemployment is generally viewed as the most important negative potential effect of raising the minimum wage, and the evidence shows that this impact is small.
          </p>
          <p>Importantly, utilitarianism must also consider positive effects. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) wrote, “By boosting the income of low-wage workers with jobs, a higher minimum wage would lift some families’ income above the poverty threshold and thus reduce the number of people in poverty” (<em>How Increasing the Federal Minimum Wage</em>, 2024). While the CBO notes that families that include workers who lost employment might see their income fall below the threshold, “the first effect would tend to be larger than the second, so the number of people in poverty would generally fall.” Further, the Urban Institute estimates that raising the minimum wage to $15 could lift almost 7.6 million people out of poverty (Acs et al., 2022). The aforementioned CBO publication includes an interactive tool that allows the user to view certain impacts of raising the minimum wage given a few parameters; for all possible combinations of parameters, the tool predicts that all family income groups earning less than three times the poverty threshold are positively affected—they experience a positive change in “real family income”—and only the group of those earning at least six times the poverty threshold experience a significant decline in total income. Overall, the estimates from both the CBO and the Urban Institute indicate a considerable positive effect on both the poverty rate and the income of low-wage workers.
          </p>
          <p>Of course, there are far more ways in which raising the minimum wage could either positively or negatively affect Americans. More research is constantly being done and some economists dispute the claim that raising the minimum wage would be right from a utilitarian perspective. While the debate is still lively, and we may never be certain of the effects of raising the federal minimum wage without trying it, the existing research is clear that past increases have led to positive effects that outweigh the negative ones. One can only predict future impacts with any accuracy with the help of induction, and the application of inductive reasoning to the existing information tells us that raising the minimum wage would provide the most utility.
          </p>
          <h3>Kantian Ethics</h3>
          <p>Kantian ethics is the dominant form of deontology. This ethical philosophy, developed by Immanuel Kant, is based on what he called “the Categorical Imperative”: “Act only on that maxim whereby thou canst at the same time will that it should become universal law” (Kant, 1783/2021, Second section, para. 32). In other words, one should act only in such a way that they would will <em>anyone</em> to act in that situation. According to Kantian ethics, it is from this rule that the morality (or immorality) of any action is derived. Thus, the Kantian arguments for and against raising the minimum wage must establish that it adheres to or violates the Categorical Imperative, respectively.
          </p>
          <p>In <em>Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals</em>, in which Kant first penned his Categorical Imperative, he formulated it again, in a slightly different way. Kant wrote, “So act as to treat humanity, whether in thine own person or in that of any other, in every case as an end withal, never as a means only” (1785/2021, Second section, para. 50). Kant believes that a morally right action treats others as ends in themselves, rather than solely as means to the moral agent’s ends. Application of the Categorical Imperative to the question of raising the minimum wage is more straightforward using this formulation. In <em>Necessity and Minimum Wage</em>, John Atherton writes, “From the employer’s standpoint a person should not be viewed as a resource or means, affirming their right to their own labour” (2016, para. 13). In fact, Atherton argues that a fair minimum wage would be even higher than the living wage advocated by many. He writes:
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 36px;">The facilitation for personal growth … aligns with the portion of the Categorical Imperative where one is both subject and sovereign, as a world in which all workers were entrenched in the circumstances of the minimum wage worker would be vastly inferior. (2016, para. 13) 
          </p>
          <p>Essentially, Atherton believes that the Categorical Imperative necessitates wages that allow low-wage workers to improve themselves and their situations, as it could not be willed that everyone be in a situation where they earn very little and have no room for growth. Providing merely a living wage, Atherton believes, would lock at least some workers into low-wage jobs with no ability to climb, and thus is immoral, and the imposition of a minimum wage above the living wage would prevent this.
          </p>
          <p>To determine whether the minimum wage must be raised in order for it to replicate or improve upon the living wage, living wages across the country must be examined. According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the McAllen-Edinburg-Mission metropolitan area in southern Texas had the lowest living wage of any metro area in the United States in 2022 (Glasmeier, 2023). As of February 2024, MIT’s Living Wage Calculator determined that the living wage for one adult working full time with no children in the McAllen-Edinburg-Mission metro area was $18.14 per hour; the lowest living wage in the area, for two working adults with no children, was $12.64 per hour per person (Glasmeier, 2024). In contrast, MIT determined that the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara metro area in California had the highest living wage of any metro area in the country in 2022 (Glasmeier, 2023). In February 2024, they found that the living wage here for one adult with no children was $32.87 per hour, and $21.52 per hour for each of two working adults with no children (Glasmeier, 2024). MIT’s calculations go up to three children—one adult with this many children would require $98.31 per hour to earn a living wage in the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara metro area. While this upper estimate is certainly unreasonable for a federal minimum wage, and the living wage is lower than $18.14 in some rural areas, every living wage estimate across the country well exceeds the current $7.25 per hour minimum wage. Thus, in order for the federal minimum wage to even just equal the lowest living wage in the country, it would need to be raised above its current level. Also, while the current and all previous federal minimum wages have applied equally to all states (only with exceptions for certain industries, certain types of workers, etc.), the federal government could take a different approach this time: by passing minimum wage legislation that dictates certain parameters and methodologies for objectively determining localized minimum wages, it could be ensured that citizens living and working in areas with high costs of living earn enough to sustain themselves and their family, without forcing more businesses and workers in areas with lower cost of living to suffer. Such legislation would need to be carefully constructed in a way that does not arbitrarily discriminate against any states, but this approach would align with the Kantian view of ethics.
          </p>
          <p>Ultimately, there are various options for how a revamped minimum wage can be approached, and many of them can be debated and improved upon. Still, due to the obligation to treat others as ends in themselves, derived from the Categorical Imperative, and the subsequent necessity of the provision of at least a living wage, Kantianism calls, at the bare minimum, for a higher federal minimum wage than $7.25 per hour.
          </p>
          <h3>Catholic Ethics</h3>
          <p>The subject of Catholic social teaching is accepted to have begun with Pope Leo XIII’s 1891 encyclical <em>Rerum Novarum</em>. Along with many others over many centuries, this papal document forms part of the foundation of the social and political beliefs of Catholic Americans, and this one in particular is applicable to the topic of the minimum wage. </p>
          <p>In <em>Rerum Novarum</em>, Leo XIII establishes a common notion that wages are agreed upon by both parties, and thus the employer cannot wrong the employee unless they fail to fulfill that agreement, and vice versa (1891). However, he notes that this argument is “not complete, for there are important considerations which it leaves out of account altogether” (para. 44). Considering that labor is (and is done because it is) necessary for survival, Leo XIII concludes that the worker has the right to earn a wage sufficient for such. In paragraph 45, he writes that “societies or boards” should be established to avoid unnecessary state intervention. However, he also recognizes that government action is sometimes required to protect the otherwise powerless working class; he writes: 
          </p>
          <p  style="margin-left: 36px;">The richer class have many ways of shielding themselves, and stand less in need of help from the State; whereas the mass of the poor have no resources of their own to fall back upon, and must chiefly depend upon the assistance of the State. And it is for this reason that wage-earners, since they mostly belong in the mass of the needy, should be specially cared for and protected by the government. (para. 37)
          </p>
          <p>By establishing a right to a fair wage, and that it is the duty of the government to protect workers’ rights, Leo XIII demonstrates a Catholic argument for keeping the minimum wage, and maybe even raising it to a living wage.</p>
          <p>In 2014, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops published a backgrounder, in which they wrote, “Catholic Bishops in the United States have long supported increases in the federal minimum wage to ensure that no full time worker and their family lived in poverty” (Office of Domestic Social Development, p. 2). This sentence alone clearly sums up the official position of the conference composed of all Catholic leaders in the United States. Providing specific examples, the paper continues, “Last year, Bishop Stephen Blaire of Stockton, CA testified to the Senate Committee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions regarding Catholic teaching on wages and the Church’s longstanding support for raising the federal minimum wage.” Additionally, it adds that Archbishop Thomas Wenski and Father Larry Snyder said to the Senate, “Just wages allow us to develop more fully as individuals, families, neighborhoods, communities, parishes, and even society as a whole. The current federal minimum wage falls short of this standard for its failure to provide sufficient resources for individuals to form and support families.”</p>
          <p>The variability and volatility of personal religious views mean that not all Catholics will agree that the minimum wage should be raised. However, it is abundantly clear that the official position of the Catholic Church is that the minimum wage should be raised at least to a <em>just</em> wage, which it contends is greater than $7.25 in the United States.</p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>The categories of utilitarianism, Kantian ethics, and Catholic ethics do not encompass the entire population of the United States, nor do even consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics. An important absence from this paper is that of Protestant ethics, as Protestant denominations encompass most American Christians. It is not necessarily clear what the natural position on the minimum wage is from the perspective of Protestantism, and the principles of <em>sola scriptura</em> and <em>sola fide</em> make it remarkably difficult to construct an argument that should convince all members of Protestant denominations. Further, some less mainstream ethical philosophies such as ethical egoism and justice theory have not been covered, and these provide interesting and nuanced conclusions. Ultimately, though, three of the most common ethical theories in the United States—utilitarianism, Kantian ethics, and Catholic ethics—all lead to the same natural conclusion: the minimum wage should be raised. From the utilitarian perspective, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. Applying Kantianism, raising the minimum wage adheres to the Categorical Imperative. Catholic social teaching leads only to the conclusion that the minimum wage should be higher than it is now. While there is no universal agreement, these converging perspectives suggest that raising the minimum wage appeals to the fundamental ethical principles of most Americans.</p>
